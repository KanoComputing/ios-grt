# ios-grt

ðŸš¨ An unmaintained proof of concept.ðŸš¨

An incomplete Objective-C wrapper for the [GRT library](https://github.com/nickgillian/grt).
The project builds into a CocoaTouch Framework for iOS.

At the moment, it exposes the following classes:

 * DTW
 * HMM
 * TimeSeriesClassificationData
 * MatrixFloat
 * VectorFloat
 * KMeansQuantizer

## Build

Don't forget to fetch submodules before building:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To build with debugging symbols:

    xcodebuild -target ios-grt -configuration Debug -sdk iphoneos clean build

Building for production:

    xcodebuild -target ios-grt -configuration Release -sdk iphoneos clean build

Building for the iOS simulator:

    xcodebuild -target ios-grt -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator clean build

The built `ios-grt.framework` will be at:

    build/${configuration}-${sdk}/ios_grt.framework
